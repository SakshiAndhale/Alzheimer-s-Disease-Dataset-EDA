# Alzheimer's Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a dataset related to Alzheimer's Disease. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights from various variables such as age, gender, blood pressure, lifestyle habits, and cognitive health markers that could influence the risk and progression of Alzheimer's Disease.

## üß† **Project Objective**
To identify key trends, correlations, and risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease by analyzing a variety of factors including demographics, lifestyle, and clinical measurements.

## üìä **Key Visualizations and Insights**

### 1. **Age Distribution**
- **Data Presented:** Number of patients across different age ranges.
- **Insight:** The majority of patients are aged between 70 and 84, peaking around 90. This age group is at the highest risk for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease.
- **Conclusion:** Early intervention should focus on individuals within the 70-90 age group.

### 2. **Gender Distribution**
- **Data Presented:** Proportion of male and female patients.
- **Insight:** Females represent 50.6%, while males represent 49.4%.
- **Conclusion:** The distribution is almost equal, suggesting that gender-specific Alzheimer‚Äôs interventions may not be necessary for this dataset.

### 3. **Ethnicity Distribution**
- **Data Presented:** Counts of different ethnic groups.
- **Insight:** 59% of the dataset is Caucasian, with African Americans and Asians making up smaller portions.
- **Conclusion:** Outreach and care programs should be tailored to ensure inclusivity across different ethnicities.

### 4. **Age by Education Level**
- **Data Presented:** Age distribution by education levels (None, Primary, Secondary, Higher).
- **Insight:** Higher education is associated with older ages and a wider age range.
- **Conclusion:** Higher education may play a role in delaying cognitive decline, possibly providing cognitive reserve.

### 5. **BMI Distribution by Diabetes Status**
- **Data Presented:** BMI distribution for patients with and without diabetes.
- **Insight:** Diabetic patients tend to have higher BMI, clustered between 25 and 40.
- **Conclusion:** Weight management programs are crucial for diabetes control, which is linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs risk.

### 6. **Systolic vs Diastolic Blood Pressure Correlation**
- **Data Presented:** Correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
- **Insight:** Weak correlation, suggesting no strong linear relationship.
- **Conclusion:** Blood pressure management remains important, but additional cardiovascular factors need to be analyzed.

### 7. **Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Diagnosis**
- **Data Presented:** Number of diagnosed vs non-diagnosed patients.
- **Insight:** 35.4% of patients are diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs.
- **Conclusion:** A significant portion of patients remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for better awareness and screening programs.

### 8. **Age Distribution by Alzheimer‚Äôs Diagnosis**
- **Data Presented:** Age distribution among diagnosed and non-diagnosed patients.
- **Insight:** Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis peaks around age 80.
- **Conclusion:** The risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs increases with age. Early screening is critical for individuals over 70.

### 9. **Cholesterol Levels by Smoking Status**
- **Data Presented:** Cholesterol levels among smokers and non-smokers.
- **Insight:** Smokers have slightly higher cholesterol levels with more variability.
- **Conclusion:** Smoking cessation can reduce cardiovascular risk factors related to Alzheimer‚Äôs.

### 10. **Memory Complaints by Education Level**
- **Data Presented:** Proportion of memory complaints across education levels.
- **Insight:** Lower education levels report more memory complaints.
- **Conclusion:** Targeted cognitive health interventions are needed for individuals with lower education levels.

### 11. **Alcohol Consumption by Cardiovascular Disease Status**
- **Data Presented:** Alcohol consumption in patients with and without cardiovascular disease.
- **Insight:** No significant variation in alcohol consumption between groups.
- **Conclusion:** Further analysis is needed to explore alcohol‚Äôs impact on cardiovascular health and Alzheimer‚Äôs risk.

### 12. **Impact of Family History on Alzheimer‚Äôs Diagnosis**
- **Data Presented:** Proportion of Alzheimer‚Äôs patients with/without a family history.
- **Insight:** Family history is a strong predictor of Alzheimer‚Äôs, with 33.9% of patients with family history diagnosed, compared to 17.8% without.
- **Conclusion:** Genetic counseling and early screening are essential for individuals with a family history of Alzheimer‚Äôs.

### 13. **Sleep Quality vs Physical Activity**
- **Data Presented:** Relationship between sleep quality and physical activity levels.
- **Insight:** Higher physical activity is associated with better sleep quality.
- **Conclusion:** Encouraging physical activity can improve sleep and potentially reduce Alzheimer‚Äôs risk.

### 14. **Depression History and Alzheimer‚Äôs Diagnosis**
- **Data Presented:** Proportion of Alzheimer's diagnosis among patients with/without a history of depression.
- **Insight:** 70% of patients with depression are diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs.
- **Conclusion:** Mental health management is crucial in reducing Alzheimer's risk, especially for those with a history of depression.

### 15. **BMI Distribution by Behavioral Problems**
- **Data Presented:** Relationship between BMI and behavioral problems.
- **Insight:** Higher BMI is associated with increased behavioral issues.
- **Conclusion:** Weight management can play a role in managing behavioral problems in Alzheimer‚Äôs patients.

## üîç **Analysis Summary**

This EDA provides valuable insights into the demographics, lifestyle factors, and clinical conditions of individuals at risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. The findings suggest:
- **Age** and **family history** are critical factors influencing Alzheimer's risk.
- **Education level** and **lifestyle habits** (such as physical activity and BMI) play significant roles in cognitive health.
- The dataset reveals potential gaps in **screening** and **early diagnosis**, emphasizing the importance of **preventive healthcare**.

## üöÄ **Conclusion**

The analysis of this dataset highlights several important aspects of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease and its risk factors. Early screening, better awareness, and targeted interventions, particularly in older adults with high-risk factors (such as family history, high BMI, and diabetes), can aid in the prevention and management of Alzheimer‚Äôs. This repository offers a foundation for future research, helping guide healthcare providers and policymakers in their approach to Alzheimer‚Äôs care.
